# Chinese-chess
Welcome to the Chinese-chess wiki!
This is a Chinese chess board game, which contains three different modes to play. 
The game is pretty similar to international chess, which allows two players to fight against each other using different types of chess on the board. ->[wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi).
When playing, the players would click on the chess on the board and move it to other places on the board to invade and finally kill the general on the other side.
